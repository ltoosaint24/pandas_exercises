### Data Visualization

* [Harvard's Data Science course](http://cs109.github.io/2014/) includes an excellent lecture on [Visualization Goals, Data Types, and Statistical Graphs](http://cm.dce.harvard.edu/2015/01/14328/L03/screen_H264LargeTalkingHead-16x9.shtml) (83 minutes), for which the [slides](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7IVstmtIvlHLTdTbXdEVENoRzQ/edit) are also available.
* Watch [Look at Your Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coNDCIMH8bk) (18 minutes) for an excellent example of why visualization is useful for understanding your data.
* For more on Pandas plotting, read this [notebook](https://github.com/fonnesbeck/Bios8366/blob/master/notebooks/Section2_7-Plotting-with-Pandas.ipynb) or the [visualization page](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html) from the official Pandas documentation.
* To learn how to customize your plots further, browse through this [notebook on matplotlib](https://github.com/fonnesbeck/Bios8366/blob/master/notebooks/Section2_4-Matplotlib.ipynb) or this [similar notebook](https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-4-Matplotlib.ipynb).
* Read [Overview of Python Visualization Tools](http://pbpython.com/visualization-tools-1.html) for a useful comparison of Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, ggplot, Bokeh, Pygal, and Plotly.
* To explore different types of visualizations and when to use them, [Choosing a Good Chart](http://extremepresentation.typepad.com/files/choosing-a-good-chart-09.pdf) and [The Graphic Continuum](http://www.coolinfographics.com/storage/post-images/The-Graphic-Continuum-POSTER.jpg) are nice one-page references, and the interactive [R Graph Catalog](http://shiny.stat.ubc.ca/r-graph-catalog/) has handy filtering capabilities.
* This [PowerPoint presentation](http://www2.research.att.com/~volinsky/DataMining/Columbia2011/Slides/Topic2-EDAViz.ppt) from Columbia's Data Mining class contains lots of good advice for properly using different types of visualizations.

**Seaborn Resources:**
* To get started with Seaborn for visualization, the official website has a series of [detailed tutorials](http://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/tutorial.html) and an [example gallery](http://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/examples/index.html).
* [Data visualization with Seaborn](https://beta.oreilly.com/learning/data-visualization-with-seaborn) is a quick tour of some of the popular types of Seaborn plots.
* [Visualizing Google Forms Data with Seaborn](http://pbpython.com/pandas-google-forms-part2.html) and [How to Create NBA Shot Charts in Python](http://savvastjortjoglou.com/nba-shot-sharts.html) are both good examples of Seaborn usage on real-world data.
